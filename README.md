# SBFem
Simulates Poisson and Elasticity problems using the Scaled Boundary FEM.
This project depends on neopz. One should have neopz installed in order to build this project.

## Note:
This repository is passing through a refactoring process to perform simulations using the RefactorGeom branch of NeoPZ and to add two new functionalities:
1. SBFEM bubble functions for 2D and 3D problems.
2. SBFEM for Mixed FE simulations.
